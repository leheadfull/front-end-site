Dream Destination Project
=========================

Overview
--------
Using my fresh skills in HTML/CSS and Bootstrap, I designed a brief project on the location of where my dream vacation would be, Mykonos, Greece.

Additionally, provided information on the flora and fauna of the city, historical sites, and what I would do there using some research and ChatGPT to help fill in the content. The task appeared simple as far as getting started but ran into a few issues later on during development.

Audience
--------
There was no suggested target audience but I imagine that a reader would want to be captivated by the pictures and learn more about the destination; moreover persuading them to visit there and understand why the city is beautiful.

In short, persuade those who love to travel why Mykonos is a beautiful destination and why they should go there.

Role
----
My role in the project was rather extensive since I was solo. I acted as the software developer by coding the web pages and the QA tester by making sure the site functioned properly and was responsive. Overall, I took on many roles to make sure that the project would come out nicely.


Constraints
-----------
Some minor issues I ran into during the development was my understanding of how to get some elements to do as I want them to do when it came to positioning them.

Responsive design was rather new to me at that point so figuring out what code to use to get the pages to look how I envisioned them was difficult. On top of that, I learned about how to use Bootstrap in my design and was encouraged to use the tool in my project. It was frustrating having to butcher my previous work to fit Bootstrap code in, so it was confusing to say the least. 

Yet, fiddling around with Bootstrap allowed me to make progress in understanding how simple and flexible it is as only light coding is needed to add cool functions.
